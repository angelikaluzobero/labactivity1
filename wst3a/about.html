        <p>My name is Angelika Luz R. Obero. I was born in Marikina City and raised in Villasis, Pangasinan. 
            I am 20 years old and my birthday is January 18, 2001. I am the youngest in the family and I 
            have a brother and his name is John Benedict. My mother is Ma. Luz Obero and my father is Ben Obero.
            <br>
            I studied Grade School in Barangobong Elementary School and Junior High School at Barangobong National High School. 
            I am consistent honor student. I graduated in Grade School as First Honorable Mention and completed Junior High as second honor. 
            I continued my Senior High School at Don Ramon E. Costales Memorial National High School taking up Technical Vocational Livelihood 
            focus on Computer System Servicing. I graduated in Senior High as With High Honors and passed the National Certificate II in CSS.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, I am Third Year College taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and currently studying in 
            Pangasinan State University - Urdaneta City Campus.
            <br>
            <br>
            My hobbies are watching kdrama and anime. I also love dancing and singing even though I'm not good at it. 
            My inspiration in life is my family of course. I want to be successful to be able to provide them a better life. 
            I also have inspirations which are my idols, Kathryn Bernardo and  the Filipino boyband, SB19. They inspire me a lot because 
            they are so successful now. I want to be like them. I love their hardwork in their crafts especially SB19. 
            For me, they are the most humble, hardworking and dedicated in their passion. They inpires me a lot because I, 
            myself, sometimes doubting my ability. 
            <br>
            <br>
             Now, I am a student of IT and I cherish the hope that my diploma will become my ticket to a better tomorrow. 
             As of now my goal is to graduate college in perfect time. And I want to develop my skills and ability to get 
             a better job in the future. 
             <br>
             <br>
            The most important life values for me is "Don't compare your progress with others. 
            We all need our own time to travel our own distance".</p>
